Playtest 1 - 2 females age 21-25

Playtime: 5min

Notes:

Player gets stuck on scenery
Controls need refining (priority design task)

Comments:

"Needs an area to move around/get used to the controls." - Needs tutorial area.

"Enemy sight is too quick." - Some build-up is needed, rather than the current instant death.

"Movement speed for hero is good."

"Took too long for enemy patrols to start." - player wasn't sure when NPC patrols would start when watching from shadow. Needs cues.

"The view is good but is maybe too close." - perhaps zoom out to encompass larger area, would allow players to see puzzles ahead of character.

"Movement controls are really awkward."

(when questioned on whether a sprint button would add anything) "No need, the speed was fine."
