Harry

 - Vector's hitbox remains for a small amount of time after killing - bug.
 - Barrels can trap player.
 - Walls collision-detection needs work.
 - Cue for turning on AI.
 - More shadows would be nice.
 - Use shadows to lead players (even if unnecessary for puzzle).
 - Turning of Guards is high priority.
 - After half-spotted (yellow) change to 'looking around state'.
 - Visual cue for range of killing.
 - Third puzzle broke during playtest (unsure why).
 - Camera should snap when player moves.
 - New controls would be nice (mouse move like Ultima or maybe numpad 8 directional).
 - Zoom in/out for camera.


Clint

 - Don't let player continue if they cannot win (judge when an impossible situation arises and tell the player). 
 - Guard judders in puzzle 2.
 - Puzzle 3 needs redesign (guard looks both ways too fast inside building).
 - Indication of being in range of target.
 - Snappy movements make the game too hard. Longer time for enemies to kill you.
 - If using 'turns yellow' for enemy vector, perhaps disable kill button during this time.
 - Puzzle 4 - green guy (walking around) looks through wall.
 - Puzzle 4 - yellow guy at beginning (next to hedge) is very difficult to kill.
 - Current puzzles aren't very challenging (in terms of deduction). Player simply has to see the opening and go to it.
 - Suggestion: no safe zones (possible hard mode) so that the player is constantly having to move out of vectors - no ability to be safe adds tension.
 - Suggestion: add NPCs who move towards player 'wait zones' so that they can never just sit and wait.
 - Skinrender looks like strong red guy - show proper picture of skinless man during tutorial/menu so players can mentally relate.
 - Suggestion: Second part of cone which triggers NPCs to walk at player (entering the shorter current part of cone will still kill player).
 - Add sounds & attack animation for visual/audio reward.
 - Objective notification: "Get the key". "Kill the officer". "Seduce the officer".
 - Skin-wearing should involve the player working out which skins are necessary for the puzzle, but other skins available for sub-optimal routes 
(such as ones involving killing of civilians).
 - Game should be a little bit more zoomed out.
 - Killing guards doesn't need an incentive beyond them being a threat to the player (but a bonus score would be nice).
