Skinrender 03/02/2016 PatchNotes

Week 10

-Code for depth sorting system rewritten to make way for other system improvements 
-Depth sorting is now centred around the camera to prevent odd visual bugs between
 adjacent levels without causing unnecessary background processing.
-Code created for a dynamic polygon vision system that will allow objects to block
 enemy vision and provide more realistic stealth gameplay.
-Players can now toggle the vision indicators with the 'V' key.
