Key things taken from playing The Art of the Theif, and Solid Sneak 

-Atmosphere seems very important in stealth games
-Rewarding sound effects and animations made waiting far more tolerable
-Found myself wanting to always be moving, using trial and error instead of planning
-When forced to wait, it is clearly known what is being waited for (Short guard patrols and suchlike)
