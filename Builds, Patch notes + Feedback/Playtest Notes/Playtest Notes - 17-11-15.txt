Notes: Males 20-27

Gameplay Feeback:
-Players took multiple attempts at even just the first area 
-1 player felt "compulsion to kill everything"
-"Camera is nice" (referring to isometric viewpoint)
-Immediately realised red guard was main target in area 3
-Players tended to die a couple of time before having a nice moment of realization and solving puzzle
-Being forced to wait at the start of a puzzle is more of a problem when restarting puzzle multiple times after deaths
-Can be hard to tell if player is in range of killing someone


Technical Feedback: 
-Streaming causes game to break
-Players got stuck in walls and obstacles quite often (players liked to hug the wall when sneaking)


Possible ideas: 
-Adding indicator to show when player is in range to kill an NPC 
-Make sure waiting is possible and beneficial, but not compulsory at the start of an area.
